A few notes on using Vagrant and VMWare Fusion to test the Havana module:

Five networks need to be setup in VMWare Fusion. The default net for
Vagrant, and the four OpenStack networks.

*  eth0: Share with my Mac
*  eth1: 192.168.11.0/24 (netmask 255.255.255.0)
*  eth2: 192.168.22.0/24 (netmask 255.255.255.0)
*  eth3: 172.16.33.0/24 (netmask 255.255.255.0)
*  eth4: 172.16.44.0/24 (netmask 255.255.255.0)

Getting these networks up and running with Vagrant and VMWare Fusion can
be a bit tricky. The networks will be set up automatically by Vagrant,
but you should take some time to set "allow promiscuous" in the VMWare
settings. The 192.* networks should be visible to your computer, the
172.* networks shouldn't (the difference between public and private).

You will likely need to reboot your computer to get the networks to behave
properly. Sorry about that.

The IP address reservation is

* 0.0.0.1  : Host OS
* 0.0.0.2  : VMWare Router
* 0.0.0.3  : Puppet Master
* 0.0.0.4  : OS Controller
* 0.0.0.5  : OS Storage
* 0.0.0.6  : OS Networking
* 0.0.0.7  : OS Compute
* 0.0.0.8  : Swift Storage Zone 1
* 0.0.0.9  : Swift Storage Zone 2
* 0.0.0.10 : Swift Storage Zone 3

Vagrant needs the hostfile plugin installed:

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostfile
```

It's assumed that you've installed a Red Hat family Vagrant
box, and have installed the latest version of Puppet from
the [Puppet Labs Repository](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/puppetlabs_package_repositories.html).

If you want to bring OpenStack up without Swift, use and look at the firstrun.sh script.
If you want to bring up Swift, use and look at the swiftrun.sh script.

For development, you can redeploy.sh script

You can log into your console through the API network and the
[Horizon interface](http://192.168.11.4).
